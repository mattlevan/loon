## Nock

The Nock VM is a Turing-complete function that maps a cell `{subject formula}`
to a noun product, where subject is the data, formula is the code, and product 
is the result.

To program in Hoon, this is all you need to know about Nock. It's probably at 
least worth skimming the definition, though.

(Also, the Hoon programmer should know that (a) tail call elimination in Nock 
is straightforward; and (b) tail calls in Hoon always become tail calls in Nock.)
